          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            <b>I have worked in the tech industry for over 4 years</b> and have experience in a
            variety of industries including Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and
            cryptography. My most recent role was as a Software Engineer at <b>MITRE</b>, a
            not-for-profit organization that operates research and development centers sponsored by
            the federal government. In this role, I worked as a key member in the
            <b>Secure by Construction</b> team, where I developed features for lab-less side-channel
            analysis framework. I also contributed to the development of a GNSS reciever testing
            architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            I graduated from <b>University of California, Davis</b> with a Bachelor of Science in
            Computer Science and Engineering. While at UC Davis, I led an undergraduate research
            project in the <b>Biological and Agricultural Engineering Lab</b> under
            <a href="https://bae.ucdavis.edu/people/farzaneh-khorsandi">Dr. Farzaneh Khorsandi</a>
            and <a href="https://bae.ucdavis.edu/people/guilherme-de">Guilherme De Moura Araujo</a>.
            Our research focused on developing an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) crash detection system
            and a companion iOS app.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>When I'm not coding</b>, I enjoy finding my next favorite band, exploring
            California's great outdoors, and hanging with my favorite cat in the world, Blue Cheese.
