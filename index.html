          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <section>
            <p>
              I love solving a tough problem. Whether it's exploring the unknown through R&D, learning
              how to lead by example to empower my team, or just finding the best way to brew a cup of
              coffee, I try to always stay curious and open to the ideas our wonderful world has to offer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I currently work at <a href="https://ai.meta.com/">Meta AI</a> as a group lead for a data
              and evaluation team supporting the amazing research engineers building the next generation
              of <a href="https://www.llama.com/">Llama-powered products</a>. My work focuses ensuring our
              AI researchers and engineers aren't held back by a lack of data to test new ideas and develop
              cutting edge machine learning models.
            </p>
            <p>
              The best part of my job? Without a doubt seeing my team find their strengths and pursue their passions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before my time at Meta, I was lucky enough to work as an Embedded Software Engineer at
              <a href="https://www.mitre.org/">MITRE</a>, a not-for-profit organization that operates Federally Funded
              Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs). I supported the <a href=https://www.mitre.org/our-impact/rd-centers/national-security-engineering-center>National Security Engineering Center</a>,
              and was fortunate to explore the worlds of embedded security, DSP, and PNT with some of the brightest
              engineers in the field.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, none of this would have been possible without the incredible folks at the
              UC Davis College of Engineering, who helped me kickstart my career. I am forever grateful for the
              support and mentorship I received while interning at the Biological and Agricultural Engineering
              department's <a href="https://bae.ucdavis.edu/">Ag Safety & Health Lab</a> under
              <a class="underline" href="https://bae.ucdavis.edu/people/farzaneh-khorsandi"
                >Dr. Farzaneh Khorsandi</a
              >
              and
              <a class="underline" href="https://bae.ucdavis.edu/people/guilherme-de"
                >Dr. Guilherme De Moura Araujo</a
              >. While interning, I supported their research for an all-terrain vehicle (ATV)
              crash detection system and a companion iOS app.
            </p>
            <p>
              Inspired by the many incredible colleagues I've crossed paths with, I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in
              Computer Science at the <a href="https://www.cc.gatech.edu/">Georgia Institute of Technology</a>. Go Yellow Jackets!
            </p>
            <p>
              When I have some downtime, I love finding my next favorite band, exploring the
              great outdoors, and hanging out with my favorite cat in the world, Blue Cheese.

                </a>
                <p>
                  A collection of utilities and experiments for managing Spotify playlists. The main
                  motivation for putting this together was a really obscure and annoying issue with
                  the way music is hosted on Spotify. Playlists that have been edited, listened to,
                  and otherwise enjoyed for several years may accumulate multiple versions of the
                  same track since Spotify is unable to recognize re-uploaded tracks. You might not
                  notice the issue until you've heard the same song three times in a row in a
                  playlist with 750 songs, but I sure have.

                  An all-terrain vehicle (ATV) crash detection system and companion iOS app. ATV
                  accidents are a leading cause of death in global agribusiness. Moreover, the vast
                  majority of these accidents are all the same type, rollovers. Our research focused
                  on developing a crash detection device that could be mounted on an ATV and alert
                  first-responders in the event of a rollover. The project required out-of-the-box
                  thinking since we had to network prototypes that were operating well outside of
                  cellular networks. Fortunately, we were able to leverage the Iridium satellite
                  network to send crash reports to our cloud infrastructure and alert
                  first-responders.

          <h1>Newsletters</h1>
          <section class="newsletters">
            <p>
              I recently decided to take a social media detox and have become a newsletter guy. It turns out having
              an actually writing team is a way better way to get news than that random angry guy on Twitter a
              recommendation algorithm thought you would "engage" with. Here are a few newsletters that I follow to
              keep an ear to the ground.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="newsletter">
                <a href="https://www.biographic.com/">bioGraphic</a>
                <p>
                  Other than having an amazing name, bioGraphic is home to some of the best environmental reporting.
                  I originally subscribed after they merged with Hakai Magazine. Particularly, I love learning about
                  marine life and conservation efforts that are being undertaken to help preserve the ecosystems
                  we have left. Hakai's weekly newsletter is a wonderful way to start a Friday morning and has
                  given me a much stronger appreciation for our water-bound friends.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="newsletter">
                <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters">Axios AM</a>
                <p>
                  Axios AM delivers clear, concise reports each morning to brief you with the day's
                  news in a nutshell. If you get really into it, they have local newsletters too.

          <h1>College Radio</h1>
          <section class="newsletters">
            <p>
              One more thing if you'll indulge me. I love music, you (hopefully) love music, and a lot of college
              students love music. So, why not support your local college radio station? Here are a few of my favorites
              (<i>totally</i> unbiased):
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="newsletter">
                <a href="https://kdvs.org/">KDVS</a>
                <p>
                  Like I said, I'm totally not biased. I totally did not work down the hall from these folks in the
                  Freeborn Hall basement for two years. KDVS is the University of California, Davis' radio
                  station. You should definitely check them out, even if it's only to oogle at their outrageously
                  large vinyl collection.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="newsletter">
                <a href="https://wmbr.org/">WMBR</a>
                <p>
                  WMBR is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's gem of a station <i>and</i> it's the first on your
                  FM dial if you're in the Boston area so you don't even have to remember a number. If you want something
                  truly unique, you have to tune in to <a href="https://wmbr.org/cgi-bin/show?id=8822">Backwoods</a> with
                  the legendary John Funke. I know of no better way to make a trip to the Somerville Market Basket 
                  even more surreal than listening to John ramble on over the sounds of birds chirping, construction constructing, 
                  the occasional ice cream truck jingle jingling, and, of course, the very best in songs about Cadillacs and chickens (yes, really).
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="newsletter">
                <a href="https://www.wrek.org/">WREK</a>
                <p>
                  Also not biased. WREK is coming at us live from the Georgia Institute of Technology. Not only named 
                  after a certain ramblin' 1930s Ford Model A, this station is also one of the top 10 highest-powered
                  college radio stations and broadcasts at 100,000 watts. Besides having a great selection of ambient and electronic
                  music WREK is also home to an extremely talented design team. I mean, just look at their website and merch!
