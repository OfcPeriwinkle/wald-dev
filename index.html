          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <section>
            <p>
              I have worked as a software engineer in the tech industry for over 4 years and have
              experience in a variety of industries including Internet of Things (IoT), cloud
              computing, and cryptography.
            </p>
            <p>
              My most recent role was at <a href="https://www.mitre.org/">MITRE</a>, a
              not-for-profit organization that operates research and development centers sponsored
              by the federal government. In this role, I worked as a key member of the
              <a href="https://mitre-engenuity.org/cybersecurity/">Secure by Construction (SbC)</a>
              team, where I developed features for a hardware security analysis framework used to
              secure cryptographic programs within simulated environments. I also contributed to the
              development of a GNSS (fancy name for GPS) receiver testing architecture.
            </p>
            <p>
              I graduated from
              <a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/">University of California, Davis</a> with a Bachelor
              of Science in Computer Science and Engineering. While at UC Davis, I led an
              undergraduate research project in the Biological and Agricultural Engineering
              department's <a href="https://bae.ucdavis.edu/">Ag Safety & Health Lab</a> under
              <a class="underline" href="https://bae.ucdavis.edu/people/farzaneh-khorsandi"
                >Dr. Farzaneh Khorsandi</a
              >
              and
              <a class="underline" href="https://bae.ucdavis.edu/people/guilherme-de"
                >Dr. Guilherme De Moura Araujo</a
              >. Our research focused on developing an all-terrain vehicle (ATV) crash detection
              system and a companion iOS app.
            </p>
            <p>
              When I'm not coding, I enjoy finding my next favorite band, exploring California's
              great outdoors, and hanging with my favorite cat in the world, Blue Cheese.

                <p>
                  A collection of utilities and experiments for managing Spotify playlists. The main
                  motivation for putting this together was a really obscure and annoying issue with
                  the way music is hosted on Spotify. Playlists that have been edited, listened to,
                  and otherwise enjoyed for several years may accumulate multiple versions of the
                  same track since Spotify is unable to recognize re-uploaded tracks. You might not
                  notice the issue until you've heard the same song three times in a row in a
                  playlist with 750 songs, but I sure have.

                <p>
                  An all-terrain vehicle (ATV) crash detection system and companion iOS app. ATV
                  accidents are a leading cause of death in global agribusiness. Moreover, the vast
                  majority of these accidents are all the same type, rollovers. Our research focused
                  on developing a crash detection device that could be mounted on an ATV and alert
                  first-responders in the event of a rollover. The project required out-of-the-box
                  thinking since we had to network prototypes that were operating well outside of
                  cellular networks. Fortunately, we were able to leverage the Iridium satellite
                  network to send crash reports to our cloud infrastructure and alert
                  first-responders.

          <h1>Newsletters</h1>
          <section class="newsletters">
            <p>
              I recently decided to take a social media detox and have become a newsletter guy. I have
              come to love the level of care and curation that goes into high-quality publications. They
              certainly beat that one guy rambling on Reddit. Here are a few newsletters that I follow
              to keep an ear to the ground.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li class="newsletter">
                <a href="https://hakaimagazine.com/newsletter-sign/">Hakai Magazine</a>
                <p>
                  I love learning about marine life and conservation efforts that are being
                  undertaken to help preserve the ecosystems we have left. Hakai's weekly newsletter
                  is a wonderful way to start a Friday morning and has given me a much stronger
                  appreciation for our water-bound friends.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="newsletter">
                <a href="https://www.developerpurpose.com/">Developer Purpose</a>
                <p>
                  I found Bennett Garner's newsletter through one of his
                  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeVCVh5MwSMJHnGY9FfRJ-Q">YouTube</a>
                  videos that popped up on my feed. I was impressed with his commitment to filtering
                  out the noise many engineers face when trying to find meaning in their careers. In
                  an ecosystem where echo chambers form around chasing TC and FAANG, it's easy to
                  get worn out. Bennett's newsletter is a breath of fresh air that gets my head back
                  into the game and gives me some big questions to kick around as I navigate my life
                  and career.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li class="newsletter">
                <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters">Axios AM</a>
                <p>
                  Could I work in tech without recommending Axios? Probably, but this media outlet
                  is overflowing with the same energy that drives Silicon Valley's startup culture.
                  Axios AM delivers clear, concise reports each morning to brief you with the day's
                  news in a nutshell. If you get really into it, they have local newsletters too.
                </p>

                  Taking a social media detox like me? Want to stay in-the-know on Gen Z trends and
                  the chaos around them? Casey Lewis has you covered. This newsletter is a fun one
                  and amasses a bunch of articles written about Gen Z with some sassy summaries if
                  you are just surfing headlines.

                  This weekly newsletter is pretty new to me. It's AI-centric, but has a smattering
                  of additional tech articles featured throughout. I think a lot of the stuff offers
                  solid tech journalism without getting into the weeds.
